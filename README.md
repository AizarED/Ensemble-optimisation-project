# Ensemble-optimisation-project
Ensemble optimisation using hyperparameter and arquitecture search. 
The  aim of this project is to get the best performance on a real dataset by combining the techniques that we have learnt throughout.



Outcome
An entire pipeline that systematically evaluate and compare different ensembles. It should allow you to find a high performing ensembles and their relevant hyperparameters.
You should even be able to apply this to other problems in the future!
